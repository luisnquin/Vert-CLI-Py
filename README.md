# Vert-CLI
A CLI made with Typer.

**Sintaxis:** ```vert <app> <command> [arg]```

By default, your persistence is in JSON, not in PostgreSQL

## User guide
In Linux, for a better experience, type ```sudo nano .zshrc``` in the last line:
```
alias vert='~/path/to/vert-cli'
```
Later: ```source .zshrc```

Once this is done, you can enjoy it just typing ***vert --help***
<br>This will drop to you a list of commands as:

```
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Commands:
  categories
  core
  gen
  ideas
  notifier
  tables
  tasks
  urls

```

Well, look the options of one command, like ```vert core --help```

Comes the most underrated part, type ```vert core version```
<br>
***Congratulations!*** ðŸŽ‰, you just have to explore the other commands in the other applications.

###  Workspace
You know what I'm talking about, the placement where your projects are, give me an absolute path as ```~/workspace/projects```

```
vert core workspace-config
```

### PostgreSQL
The option for a better performance

 - Type ```vert core db-config``` to set your settings, previously you need to create an PSQL database
 - Later ```vert core change-persistence``` and select ***PostgreSQL***.
 - To build your tables in your database, type ```vert tables rebuild```
